## **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iklobato/automatic-linkedin-answer-ai.git
   cd automatic-linkedin-answer-ai
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv install 
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file:
     ```bash
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```
   - Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your OpenAI API key.

4. **Prepare Documents**:
   - Place your resume and other professional documents in the `docs/` directory.
   - Supported formats: `.txt`.

5. **Configure `config.yaml`**:
   ```yaml
   linkedin:
     username: "your@email.com"
     password: "your_password"
   deepseek:
     api_key: "your_openai_api_key"
     model: "gpt-4o"
   documents_dir: "docs/"
   bot_disclaimer: "ðŸ¤– Automated Response: This is an AI assistant. I'll respond based on my resume and experiences."
   ```

## **Usage**

1. **Run the Bot**:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

2. **How It Works**:
   - The bot logs into LinkedIn using your credentials.
   - It navigates to your messages and checks for new recruiter messages.
   - For each new message, it retrieves relevant information from your documents and generates a response using OpenAI's GPT model.
   - The bot sends the response with a disclaimer indicating it's an automated reply.

3. **Monitor Logs**:
   - The bot logs all actions (e.g., new messages, replies, errors) for debugging.
   - Logs are saved in the console with timestamps.

## **Customization**

### **1. Add More Documents**
- Place additional `.txt` files in the `docs/` directory.
- The bot will automatically include them in its knowledge base.

### **2. Adjust Response Style**
- Modify the `bot_disclaimer` in `config.yaml` to change the bot's tone.
- Update the `system_prompt` in the `generate_response` function for custom instructions.

### **3. Fine-Tune for Precision**
- Use OpenAI's fine-tuning API to train a custom model on your specific dataset.
- Replace the `ChatOpenAI` model with your fine-tuned model.

## **Example Workflow**

1. **Recruiter Message**:
   ```
   Hi, I came across your profile and noticed your experience with Python. Can you tell me more about your projects?
   ```

2. **Bot Response**:
   ```
   ðŸ¤– Automated Response: This is an AI assistant. I'll respond based on my resume and experiences.

   I have worked on several Python projects, including a machine learning model for predicting customer churn and a web scraper for data analysis. You can find more details in my resume.
   ```

## **Troubleshooting**

### **1. Login Issues**
- Ensure your LinkedIn credentials in `config.yaml` are correct.
- If LinkedIn blocks the login attempt, try using a browser session to verify your account.

### **2. No Responses**
- Check the logs for errors.
- Ensure your documents in the `docs/` directory contain relevant information.

### **3. Rate Limits**
- If OpenAI API rate limits are hit, reduce the bot's polling frequency by increasing the `time.sleep()` duration.
